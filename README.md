# otf_whisper
Some scripts for real-time transcription and translation using whisper model

## requirements
At present I am using the following packages at their lastest version:

* [Speech Recognition](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition) 
* [Faster Whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper)

(and all required dependencies)

## License

Dependencies have their own respective licensing.
Since the base is OpenAI's [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) model and it is release with a MIT license, I will go for the same model.

otf_whisper is a collection of free script software release under the terms of the MIT license.
See the [License](LICENSE) file for more details.
